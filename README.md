# Home Assistant Mastodon Profile Stats Integration

**This integration has now been retired.**

With the 2024.9 release of Home Assistant the official Mastodon integration has been enhanced to include statistics, meeting feature parity with this custom integration. Therefore I will be retiring this integration and am now a code owner for the official one and will continue improving/maintaining things there.

How do you remove the custom integration and move to core?
* Within Settings, Devices & Services, Integrations, open Mastodon Profile Stats.
* Use the 3 dots to choose Delete
* Then within HACS find Mastodon Profile Stats, and choose Delete to remove the custom integration.
* Restart HA
* Go to Settings, Devices & Services, Integrations and click Add Integration
* Search for Mastodon and follow the integration steps.

Thanks to everyone who supported this integration.
